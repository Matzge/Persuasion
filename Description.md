# Description of our Simulation

1.) We create n observations. True state of the world. <br>
2.) We create n corresponding Signals stochastically, following the properties of the information System (precision).<br>
3.) We calculate the perceived precision of the Signals by using our constructed data sheet.<br>
4.) We use this perceived Precision to calculate our Posterior.<br>
5.) We create Signals again an let the Receiver act according to its decision rule.<br>
6.) We repeat this with t Trials to approximate the Sender's expected utility for a given precision.
