# Description of our Simulation

1.) We create n observations. True state of the world.
2.) We create n corresponding Signals stochastically, following the properties of the information System (precision).
3.) We calculate the perceived precision of the Signals by using our constructed data sheet.
4.) We use this perceived Precision to calculate our Posterior.
5.) We create Signals again an let the Receiver act according to its decision rule.
6.) we repeat this with t Trials to approximate the Sender's expected utility for a given precision.
